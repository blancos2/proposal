    <h1>PROJECT PROPOSAL </h1>
    <p>For my project, I want to create a battle simulator that simulates a battle for Honkai: Star Rail. The simulator will allow you to select from the various characters and customize the loadout/what happens at certain intervals, and then calculate what the round of combat will look like. 
    The sim will allow you to adjust how many rounds of combat you want to simulate, as well as if you want to account for any enemies turn. This will be accomplished primarily through extensive use of Javascript. The combat scenarios are calculated by determining which is the next upcoming move, and then evaluating what stats need to be updated. It will then select that action, and update the sim accordingly. Where you input the moves will be stores in a small menu on the side that will collapse to improve visibility. 

If time allows, I will also create a display page for various effects/display the levels of moves and their values, which will be under the wiki tab.  </p>

        <br> Battle sim is calculative recurisively using Javascript. Drop down menu allows you to input moves that affect SPD or AV.
